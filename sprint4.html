                If you understand the principles of neuroplasticity and that it’s the brains ability to continuously change and adapt throughout your life, this will be hugely beneficial to your learning.
                Once a person realises that their brain is capable of taking on any new knowledge and skills it creates a positive environment to learn. The best way to increase neuroplasticity is to practice and engage regularly with what you are wanting to learn. The more effort the bigger the reward.
                I am finding that this is the case on my own learning journey and even if I’m not understanding the information so long as I just keep on trying and listening and being open to the idea it will be come easier. It does. Slowly, but it happens. </p>

                Growth mindset can be the difference between success and failure so the relevance of growth mindset is also greatly important.
                Although I have been aware of this concept for a long time, I realised when I hit a difficult part of my learning process in sprint 2,  that I hadn’t been practicing in a growth mindset. 
                After many years of working in an area where I was pretty confident and knowledgeable, I totally struggled when faced with brand new information which was totally unlike the environment and teachings I have had to date. I was quickly sinking into a ‘fixed’ mindset and questioning my intelligence, abilities, my parenting, my relationship, myself as a person. 
                This week I still have the same struggles with understanding the concepts but I have a renewed sense of faith in myself and trust in the process. Thanks to tapping back into my long since used ‘growth’ mindset.</p>
