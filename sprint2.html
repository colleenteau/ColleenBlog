            Since a very young age I’ve always had a keen sense of social justice, that irrespective of a person’s gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social position, income, education, health, abilities that everyone deserves a fair chance. 

                As I grew, learning and experiencing the world around me  I came to understand that it wasn’t necessarily fairness that I expected in situations but equity. If people have equitable use of resources, education and training this can put them on a level playing field to take advantage of opportunities and to experience actual fairness.
                
                According to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator I fit the psychological typology ENFP (Extraversion, intuition, Feeling,Perception). This is interpreted  as being outgoing, creative having the ability to perceive complicated patterns, information and to assimilate it quickly. Have flexibility be highly adaptable workers. Be driven by a keen devotion to their ideals and a strong drive to help others.
                
                Interestingly these indicators correlate perfectly with how I conduct my journey but so too do the challenges of the ENFP personaltiy type. Such as having less patience for routine tasks and projecting an image of seriousness and commitment. It’s also accurate that I need significant alone time to centre myself and ensure I continue in the direction that syncs with my values.
                
                So basically I’m a messy, impatient, idealist. In order to make it through the days in my head I have to constantly practice self awareness. My empathy and need to help people would totally consume my own needs and wants if I didn’t stop and check myself.
                
                Understanding this quirk in my personality has been invaluable in ethical decision making.
                
                I am lucky enough to have very recently reflected on ethical and decision making processes in many different scenarios. I went through a challenging ethical decision making process to support environmental and cultural change within an organisation. Part of the process was restructuring staff roles. This has been a huge learning experience of how ‘ideals’ impact on real world consequences, people, organisations and the perceived greater good. It was ethically demanding as it involved challenging peoples behaviours and made me question myself constantly, having to weigh up the impact on individual circumstances in comparison to the impact on the future direction and survival of the organisation and the ever present needs with in our community.
                Life is multifaceted and of course absolutely all of your experiences and learning affect your decision making processes, consciously  and unconsciously.
