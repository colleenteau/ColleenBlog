        <p>Command Line Reflection:
            <br>
                Command tool you give it instructions and it finds what you need.
                No I didn’t because I didn’t understand what I was doing.
                •	Ls – listing what was in a file
                •	Cd changing directory
                •	Mkdir making a directory
                •	Touch make or create a file directory
                •	Cat – showing the content
                It took me a long time to start to understand the terminal being git and the directory being windows/ file directory.  That was a surprise because I thought after hours of rewatching you tube and starting again that I would never even begin to understand what was going on.
                Version control Reflection:
                Git is software as in you download it to your computer – Git Hub is a service that you sign up to, to interact with the software and share with others and store content – kind of like a social media app?
                Git is where you build and GitHub is where you share what you are building and make it better, get tips and support, eventually show off. It’s like mission control?
                If I don’t revisit this information regularly, I will not remember it – although today I believe I wont forget Git, GitHub and version control!
                I did not keep to the recommended time as currently I need a lot more to get my head around it all.
                Install and Explore Reflection:
                I have not finished this - I’m thinking that the workflow is a series of changes recorded as ‘commits’ as part of the bigger picture. I’m unsure as yet how this works
                I need to constantly go back and relook at information, often starting from the beginning over and over until I get a flicker of understanding, not quite ‘lightbulb’ moments yet.
                In a perfect world I would make sure I was a lot more familiar with my new computer and windows 10. I would be totally uninterrupted which is an absolute luxury and I would have a better seat.
                I don’t feel like I’m adequately set up with GIT and GitHub – something is missing, I’m missing something important. I haven’t made a project, repository to enable me to make checkpoints, commits. I need to understand repositories and branches better.
                Your git Commit history is visible to us and we use it to assess your participation and engagement. Throughout the course we'll be looking at the frequency and consistency. So engage daily and commit often. That means when ever you add something that works, remove something, or fix something, commit it.
                How do I do this?? Where is this available…
                
                
                
                Track and commit Primer Reflection:
                Commits are regular checkpoints on a journey. If you get lost or take a wrong turn you can go back and explore another path. You can leave instructions and updates at the checkpoints so  you remember what happened on the journey. Commits are safety nets so you don’t get lost or lose your way back.
                
                Branch, Pull, Merge, Primer Reflection:
                Master is the original repository, project, it’s the master copy the master plan.
                You would create a branch to make changes, fix things, try new ideas. You would create a new branch to test theories without affecting the master plan or overriding anyone elses work.
                The introduced concepts feel like I’m trying to communicate with someone in a different language and I have no idea what they are saying. But I can pick up on their expressions and emotions through non verbal cues.
                So both difficult to understand and intuitive
