  <h2>Something About Me, Myself and I</h2>
    <p>
       Hi everyone, I’m Colleen Te Au. I was born in and returned to live in
       Gore, Southland.  Don’t hold that against me haha! As a result I’m well
       travelled and have lived abroad. My background and skillset is in social
       work and community development. I value loyalty, honesty, empathy and 
       kindness. I’m a mum to four pretty amazing kids and that keeps things real
       on my journey. Really real. After a nearly 20 year career in Social Services
       I felt it was now or never to jump on the tech train and pursue the line
       of work I had actually planned on doing. I’m a strong and determined person,
       the consummate team player and great to have in your corner when the chips
       are down. I’m attending EDA because I believe the skills I can learn here
       and networks will provide a great platform to open doors to creativity and
       opportunities. My dream is to be proficient enough in web development to 
       work on my own ideas, travel and work remotely. I’m looking forward to living
       in Wellington for a couple of months, meeting you all, forging lifelong 
       links and sharing on this adventure. Nga mihi nui </p>
